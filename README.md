# Verilog Modules Library [![Lint Status](https://github.com/MrAbhi19/Verilog_Library/actions/workflows/verilog-lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MrAbhi19/Verilog_Library/actions/workflows/verilog-lint.yml)

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/MrAbhi19/Verilog_Library)

A growing collection of reusable, parameterized Verilog modules designed for learning, rapid prototyping, and integration into larger digital design projects. The goal of this repository is to maintain a clean, modular, and extensible library of hardware building blocks—each paired with testbenches, simulation waveforms, and clear documentation.

This project is open for contributions in all forms: modules, testbenches, waveform captures, documentation, and ideas for upcoming designs.

## 🛡️ Linting Policy

This repository enforces **strict linting** using Verilator in GitHub Actions:

- **Warnings are treated as errors** — even minor issues like unused signals or width mismatches will fail the workflow.
- **Style and synthesis safety enforced** — checks include unused signals, width mismatches, implicit nets, unreachable code, and clock/reset handling.

This strict setup guarantees that all HDL code here is **clean, reproducible, and synthesis‑safe**.  
**✅ Every module in this repository is lint‑clean under Verilator strict mode.**

---
## ✨ Features

- **Reusable modules** — Clean, synthesizable Verilog with parameterization wherever applicable.
- **Structured directories** — Each module has its own folder containing:
  - Source files (`.v`)
  - Testbench
  - Waveform outputs (`.vcd` / screenshots)
  - Notes or design explanations
- **Beginner-friendly** — Easy for students, hobbyists, and engineers.
- **Open for collaboration** — Ideas and discussions welcome in the GitHub Discussions section.
