# Verilog Modules Library

A growing collection of reusable, parameterized Verilog modules designed for learning, rapid prototyping, and integration into larger digital design projects. The goal of this repository is to maintain a clean, modular, and extensible library of hardware building blocks—each paired with testbenches, simulation waveforms, and clear documentation.

This project is open for contributions in all forms: modules, testbenches, waveform captures, documentation, and ideas for upcoming designs.

## ✨ Features

- **Reusable modules** — Clean, synthesizable Verilog with parameterization wherever applicable.
- **Structured directories** — Each module has its own folder containing:
  - Source files (`.v`)
  - Testbench
  - Waveform outputs (`.vcd` / screenshots)
  - Notes or design explanations
- **Beginner-friendly** — Easy for students, hobbyists, and engineers.
- **Open for collaboration** — Ideas and discussions welcome in the GitHub Discussions section.

Examples:

- SPI (Master and Slaves)
- UART (Receiver and Transmitter)
- ALU
- Full Adder  
- Bidirectional Counter  
- Pre-Scaler  
- Shift Registers (SISO, SIPO, PISO, PIPO)
- Gray-Coded Counter
